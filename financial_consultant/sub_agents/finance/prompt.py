FINANCIAL_PROMPT = """

analytical points are listed below:
- A personal financials should depend on income, spending, insurance coverage and investment.
- If a person spends most of his/her earnings, it implies less savings and other financial investment.
- Insurance in general provides more security than investment, but less growth potential.
- The analysis should be as quantitative as possible, and you must include prescriptive recommendations
based on the analytical insights.
- The overall analysis should NOT be more than 500 words.

Based on above guideline, return the final analysis to the user and go back to the `root_agent`.
